Installation
=============

You need cmake ≥2.6 in order to generate the makefiles, else you will get an error message like Unknown CMake command "FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS" and the cmake version check may fail, too.

Install dependencies on Ubuntu
------------------------------

On a freshly installed Ubuntu it should be sufficient to install these packages:

::

   > sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-filesystem-dev \
        libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev \
        libboost-program-options-dev \
	libcppunit-dev \
	doxygen g++ gdb libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libxml++2.6-dev \
        libfreetype6-dev libzip-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev \
        libxmlrpc-c++8-dev libtiff-dev libpng-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev


Install dependencies on Mac OS X
----------------------------------

You need the Mac Ports (or whatever the recent port system is) and Xcode (≥ 3.1) in order to build gtkmm and related libraries. If you have installed it, you can start your terminal and run:

::
   
   > sudo port install gtkmm cmake boost cppunit doxygen freetype \
     libglademm libxmlxx2 libzip xmlrpc-c gtkglextmm gnome-icon-theme
